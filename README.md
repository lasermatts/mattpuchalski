# Hi! I'm Matt Puchalski!

## I'm a big ðŸª´gardening ðŸª´ and ðŸ¤– robots ðŸ¤– dork!

Author of [A Pandemic Gardening Journal](https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-pandemic-gardening-journal-matt-puchalski/19997149?ean=9798987899403) and I blog about [gardening, robotics, and whatever books I'm reading](https://www.mattp.tech/the-pittsburgh-roboticist-blog)

I primarily work in python, and most of my projects revolve around some kind of automation or data analysis for my garden/home projects/other hobbies!
